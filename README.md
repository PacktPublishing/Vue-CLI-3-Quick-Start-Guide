This is the code repository for [Vue CLI 3 Quick Start Guide](Packt UTM URL of the Book), published by Packt.

**Build and maintain Vue.js applications quickly with the standard CLI**

## What is this book about?
The sprawling landscape of various tools in JavaScript web development is becoming overwhelming. This book will show you how Vue CLI 3 can help you take back control of the tool chain. To that end, we'll begin by configuring webpack, utilizing HMR, and using single-file .vue components. We'll also use SCSS, ECMAScript, and TypeScript. We'll unit test with Jest and perform E2E testing with Cypress.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Work with nvm, install Node.js and npm, use Vue CLI 3 with no configuration, via the command line and the graphical user interface
* Build a Vue project from scratch using npm and webpack, and learn about hot module replacement
* Work with Babel settings, configurations, and presets
* Work with Vue plugins, including testing plugins such as Jest and Cypress
* Write, run, and watch unit and E2E tests using TDD assertions in the red-green-refactor cycle
